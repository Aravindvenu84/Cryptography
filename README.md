Cryptography plays a vital role in cybersecurity by ensuring that digital information remains secure, trustworthy, and protected from unauthorized access. At its core, 
cryptography uses mathematical algorithms to convert readable data into an unreadable format, ensuring confidentiality so that only authorized individuals or systems can access sensitive information. 
This is especially important for protecting personal data, financial transactions, and organizational secrets.
