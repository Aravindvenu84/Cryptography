Cryptography plays a vital role in cybersecurity by ensuring that digital information remains secure, trustworthy, and protected from unauthorized access. At its core, 
cryptography uses mathematical algorithms to convert readable data into an unreadable format, ensuring confidentiality so that only authorized individuals or systems can access sensitive information. 
This is especially important for protecting personal data, financial transactions, and organizational secrets.

In addition to confidentiality, cryptography ensures integrity by enabling systems to detect whether data has been altered during storage or transmission. Techniques such as hashing and digital signatures help verify that information remains accurate and unmodified. Cryptography also supports authentication, allowing users, devices, and servers to verify each other’s identities, which helps prevent impersonation and unauthorized access. Furthermore, non-repudiation ensures that actions such as sending messages or approving transactions cannot be denied later, providing accountability and trust in digital systems.

Cryptography is widely used in real-world cybersecurity applications, including SSL/TLS for secure web browsing, VPNs for encrypted network communication, secure email, password hashing, and digital certificates. It protects data both in transit and at rest, safeguarding information even if systems are compromised. Without cryptography, modern cybersecurity would be ineffective, as attackers could easily intercept, manipulate, or steal data. Therefore, cryptography is essential for maintaining privacy, trust, and security in today’s digital world.
