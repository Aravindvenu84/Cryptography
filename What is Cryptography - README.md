Cryptography is the science and practice of securing information by transforming it into a form that only authorized parties can understand.
In simple words: it protects data from being read or altered by unauthorized people.
Key points:


It uses mathematical algorithms and keys to encrypt (lock) and decrypt (unlock) data.


The original readable data is called plaintext.


The protected, unreadable form is called ciphertext.


Main purposes of cryptography:


Confidentiality – Only intended users can read the data.


Integrity – Data cannot be changed without detection.


Authentication – Verifies the identity of users or systems.


Non-repudiation – Sender cannot deny sending the message.


Simple definition:

Cryptography is the technique of using mathematics and algorithms to secure communication and data from attackers.
